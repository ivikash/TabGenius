# Tab Genius Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: March 10, 2025*

## Introduction

Tab Genius ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your data when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

Tab Genius collects the following types of data to provide its tab organization functionality:

1. **Tab Information**: We access information about your open browser tabs, including URLs, titles, and tab states.

2. **Website Content**: To categorize your tabs effectively, we temporarily access and analyze the content of webpages you have open in your browser. This may include text content, headings, and meta descriptions from these pages.

3. **Extension Settings**: We store your preferences for the extension, such as your chosen categorization settings, AI model preferences, and custom categories.

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

1. **Tab Organization**: Analyzing tab content to categorize and group similar tabs together.

2. **Extension Functionality**: Enabling core features like sorting tabs, creating tab groups, and restoring previous tab arrangements.

3. **User Preferences**: Storing your settings to provide a consistent experience across browser sessions.

## Data Storage and Sharing

- **Local Processing**: When using local AI models (like Ollama), all content analysis happens entirely on your device. No tab content or URLs are transmitted to external servers.

- **Chrome's Built-in AI**: When using Chrome's built-in Gemini model, data processing occurs within the browser environment according to Google Chrome's privacy practices.

- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share any of your data with third parties.

- **No External Servers**: Tab Genius does not maintain any external servers that collect or store your data.

## Data Retention

- **Temporary Processing**: Tab content is only accessed and analyzed temporarily during the categorization process and is not permanently stored by the extension.

- **Local Storage**: Your extension settings are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API.

## Your Choices and Control

- **Optional Features**: You can choose which AI model to use for categorization, including privacy-focused local options.

- **Extension Permissions**: You can review the permissions required by Tab Genius in your browser's extension settings.

- **Uninstallation**: You can uninstall the extension at any time, which will remove all locally stored settings.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store listing and updating the "Last Updated" date.
